        <h3>Youtube Question Player</h3>

<p>Online classes are the big new thing, and everyone everywhere is uploading tutorial videos to youtube. But to make these properly effective there needs to be a way to keep user's attention and make sure they're not zoning out.</p>

<p>The Youtube Question Player hooks into a youtube video and allows you to set timepoints for questions to pop up. The user then has the opportunity to answer and check, and go back and re-watch that section if they get the wrong answer.</p>

<h3>Multiple Question Tracks per Video</h3>

<p>Any one video can have multiple question tracks, each displayed separately. This allows for different levels of testing and guidance.</p>

<h3>Save and Submit</h3>

<p>Tracks will have the option to generate a pdf of answers at the end of the video, and also to submit these to an instructor.</p>
