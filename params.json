{"name":"Youtube Question Player","tagline":"Enables youtube to be used in conjunction with paused pop-up questions.","body":"### Youtube Question Player\r\nOnline classes are the big new thing, and everyone everywhere is uploading tutorial videos to youtube. But to make these properly effective there needs to be a way to keep user's attention and make sure they're not zoning out.\r\n\r\nThe Youtube Question Player hooks into a youtube video and allows you to set timepoints for questions to pop up. The user then has the opportunity to answer and check, and go back and re-watch that section if they get the wrong answer.\r\n\r\n### Multiple Question Tracks per Video\r\nAny one video can have multiple question tracks, each displayed separately. This allows for different levels of testing and guidance.\r\n\r\n### Save and Submit\r\nTracks will have the option to generate a pdf of answers at the end of the video, and also to submit these to an instructor.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@AvengingSyndrome started playing around with this idea in late 2011, with a demo for a course he was taking. @bethc made a whole bunch of lists and plans in late 2012 and it went from there.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact @AvengingSyndrome or @bethc for questions or support.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
